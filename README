Plucene
=======

Plucene is a Perl port of the Java Lucene search engine.
(http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/) In the same way as Lucene, it is not
a standalone application, but a library you can use to index documents
and search for things in them later.

Using Plucene
=============

Plucene, like Lucene, is designed to be extended, and allows you to
construct your own query types, analyzers, and so on. Future versions of
Lucene will contain more of these, as well as instructions for how to
subclass the base modules to create your own.

More information
================

The Plucene web site is at ....
There is a mailing list at ....

Of course, since Plucene is almost a straight port of Java Lucene,
everything said about Lucene at http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/ should
be true about Plucene. Apart from the bits about it being in Java.
